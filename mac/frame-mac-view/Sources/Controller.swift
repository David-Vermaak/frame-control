// Adapts each stream to its network, latency first. The viewer acknowledges
// every frame as it arrives ("rx"); from those acks the controller knows how
// long frames take to get through and how fast the link delivers them.
//
// - The gate: a new frame is sent only while the oldest unacknowledged one is
//   younger than the path's usual round trip plus a little slack. So frames
//   never queue up in SSH, TCP or the Wi-Fi driver; while the link is stuck
//   the newest picture waits and goes out as soon as it moves again.
// - The bitrate: when frames start queueing (the round trip grows) or the
//   gate has to hold frames back, it drops to a bit under what the link
//   actually delivered; once things are clear it probes up again slowly, never
//   above the quality setting's bitrate (the ceiling).
// - The tier: as the bitrate falls, fewer frames per second (60, 45, 30), then
//   a smaller picture (75%, then 50% of the panel's pixels).
// See docs/mac-in-headset.md ("Adapting to the network"). Thread-safe.
