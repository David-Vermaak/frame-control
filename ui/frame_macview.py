"""Mac in the headset: stream Mac windows or displays into the Steam Frame as
panels you can place anywhere, with the laser, wheel and keys driving the Mac.

Runs on the Mac, inside Frame Control's server. The pieces:

- mac/bin/frame-mac-view (Swift, built from mac/frame-mac-view): captures with
  ScreenCaptureKit, encodes with VideoToolbox, serves ui/mac-view.html and one
  WebSocket per stream on 127.0.0.1, and plays input back with CGEvent.
- An `ssh -R` tunnel, so the Frame reaches the agent on its own 127.0.0.1.
  Every request carries a random token, so other programs on the Frame
  (Android apps included) can't watch or drive the Mac.
- A Chromium app window on the Frame per stream, on gamescope's X display
  with its own STEAM_GAME id, which makes it its own SteamVR panel (see
  docs/panels.md). Chromium XR (~/chromium-xr) is preferred because it's
  built with H.264; Flathub Chromium is the fallback.

On Linux the agent is ui/frame_desktopview.py instead, with the same
protocol: the desktop's portal picks a screen or window (POST /pick, which
shows its dialog on this computer), PipeWire and GStreamer capture and encode
it, and the portal's RemoteDesktop session plays input back. It runs on the
system's python3, which has PyGObject and GStreamer; the app's own Python
doesn't.

Stdlib only. MacView gets a plain ssh argv for the tunnel (its own
connection) and the server's `run(remote, stdin=, timeout=)` for commands.
